Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
A dictionary is a collection which is ordered, changeable and do not allow duplicates values.
When we say that dictionaries are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
Unordered means that the items do not have a defined order, you cannot refer to an item by using an index.
Dictionaries are changeable, meaning that we can change, add or remove items after the dictionary has been created.
Dictionaries cannot have two items with the same key:
Dictionaries are written with curly brackets, and have keys and values:

mydict={1:'one',2:'two',3:'three'} #with integer keys
mydict

#The below function is used to get the keys in the dictionary.
mydict={1:'one',2:'two',3:'three'}
mydict.keys()
#The below function is used to get the values in the dictionary.
mydict={1:'one',2:'two',3:'three'}
mydict.values()
#The below function is used to get the items(keys and values both) in the dictionary.
mydict.items()

#creating dictionary using dict()
mydict1 = dict({1:'one', 2:'two', 3:'three'}) 
mydict1

#dictionary with one value as list.
mydict1= {1:'one',2:'two','A':['Data','john','maria']} 
mydict1


#we can add list 
d={0:{'one':1,'two':2,'three':3,'four':4},
   1:{'city':'banglore','area':'kudlu'},
  'three':{'city':'mumbai','area':'dharvi'}}
d

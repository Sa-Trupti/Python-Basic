Tuple is similar to list except that the objects of the tuple are immutable.that means we can't change the tuple.
Tuple elements are encolsed with () & the elements separated by comma.
Access based on index.
Updation is not allowed in tuple.
Tuple can be homogenous as well as hetrogenous.

#creating empty tuple using keywords
T1=()
T1= tuple()
T1

#Using the len command which is basically length command we get to know the length of the tuple.
Tup=("apple", "banana", "cherry")
len(Tup)

1=(12,23,34,45) #this is the homogenous tuple which contains only single type of datatype.
T2=(22,33,'mango','grapes',78.5) # This is the hetrogenous tuple which contain difftrent type of data type.
T2

T1[2] # here by giving index number we can get what is in that index,its called indexing.

a,b= (5,6) #this is the tuple unpacking.

T2=(22,33,'mango','grapes',78.5)
T2[3]=8
#Here erroe will occur bcz tuple object doesnot support item assignment.

T2=(22,33,'mango','grapes',78.5)
del T2
#we can't perform delete operation in tuple bcz tuple does not support updation and deletion.

tup=(20,50,"data",78,[56,89],[22,33,44],{"turpti","Rohit"},(65,26))
#this is a nested tuple.
len(tup)

tup[5][1]
#if we want to find the element inthe nested tuple then we can find like this.

tup=(20,50,"data",78,[56,89],[22,33,44],{"turpti","Rohit"},(65,26))
tup[-1]
#this is the minus indexing . it will start from right to left so the last element will fatch.

tup2=(20,50,"data",78,[56,89],[22,33,44],["turpti","Rohit"],(65,26))
tup2[4][0]=60
#In Tupple element assignment is not supported .so the assign operation is not working here.

tup3=('one','two','three','one','two','four','one','two','three')
tup3.count('one')
#the count function is used to count the element which is given how many time it occur in tuple.

tup3.index('three')
#it will give the first index location of the element which is given.

80 in tup3
#in operator is give the boolean value.It check 80 is present in the tuple or not.Accordingly it will give true or false value.

'80'not in tup3
#it will check if 80 is not present in this tuple.

tup4 = (45,87,90,12,54,49,38)
a=sorted(tup4)
print(a)
#Sorted function is used to sort the elements in assending order.

tup4 = (45,87,90,12,54,49,38)
a=sorted(tup4,reverse=True)
print(a)
#It will sort the tuple in desending order.

tup5=(4,7,9,'9',56,98,'7')
sorted(tup5)
#we cant perform sorted operation in diffrent datatypes.
